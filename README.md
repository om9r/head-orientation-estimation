# head-orientation-estimation
This project estimates the 3D orientation of a human head (yaw, pitch, roll) from a single 2D image using facial landmarks provided by dlib's facial landmark detector . By mapping 2D facial landmarks to a predefined 3D model of the face and solving a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem, the head pose is calculated relative to the camera.
